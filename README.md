# Lubuntu.me

This is the meat and potatoes for Lubuntu's official website, located at [Lubuntu.me](https://lubuntu.me/), that is deployed by [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com/). This is in order to keep things transparent and open for the community.

The people who have access to the Lubuntu website (minus the Canonical system administators, who won't actually post on the site) are in [~lubuntu-website-admins](https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-website-admins). If you feel like you should have access to this site or if you see something wrong, you can either [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lubuntu-team/lubuntu.me/issues/new), [send us an email](mailto:lubuntu-admins@lists.launchpad.net), or let us know on one of the [many platforms we're on](https://lubuntu.me/links/).

Looking for release announcements? Take a look at our repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/lubuntu-team/release-announcements) or [Launchpad](https://git.launchpad.net/~lubuntu-product-managers/+git/release-announcements).
