= Usage =

Create your custom 404 error page just like any other page using the WordPress Page Editor. Then go to 'Appearance' -> '404 Error Page' and select the created page as your custom 404 error page. That's it!

* Different from other similar plugins the 404page plugin **does not create redirects**. Thatâ€™s **quite important** because a correct code 404 is delivered which tells search engines that the page does not exist and has to be removed from the index. A redirect would result in a HTTP code 301 or 302 and the URL would remain in the search index.
* Different from other similar plugins the 404page plugin **does not create additional server requests**.

== For developers ==

= Action Hook =

= Native Support =
If you are a theme developer you can add native support for the 404page plugin to your theme for full control. [Read more](http://petersplugins.com/docs/404page/#theme_native_support).

== Screenshots ==

1. Create your costom 404 Error Page as a normal WordPress Page
2. Set the created Page as 404 Error Page
3. Advanced Settings
4. Advanced Settings with WPML plugin installed (Compatibility Mode is not available, because the 404page plugin automatically switches to WMPL mode)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any requirements? =

To enable the WordPress 404 error handling you have to set the Permalink Structure ('Settings' -> 'Permalinks') to anything else but 'Default'. Otherwise 404 errors are handled by the webserver and not by WordPress.

= Are 404 errors redirected? =

No, there is no redirection! The chosen page is delivered as a 'real' 404 error page. This results in a HTTP 404 code and not in 301 or 302, which is important for Search Engines to tell them, that the page does not exist and should be deleted from the index.

= Is it possible to add custom CSS to the 404 page? =

The 404page plugin adds a CSS class `error404` to the `<body>` tag which can be used for extra styling.
